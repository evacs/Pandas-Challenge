    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "- The following analysis shows the performance of several schools and investigates some possible factors that could contribute to passing rates. The factors include:\n",
    "    - School type (charter/district)\n",
    "    - School size (# of students)\n",
    "    - Budget per student\n",
    "- From the comparisons, I've drawn the following conclusions:\n",
    "    - Charter schools outperform district schools, especially in math scores.\n",
    "    - Medium size schools perform better than both large and small schools. There are no small district schools, but\n",
    "    there is one large charter school. This school performed very highly. This indicates that the size of the school\n",
    "    isn't a significant contributing factor, but rather the school type is.\n",
    "    - Surprisingly, the higher the budget per student, the lower the overall performance of the school. The charter\n",
    "    schools typically had lower spending budgets, so once again, performance seems to be based mostly on school type.\n",
    "    - School type is the largest contributing factor to higher student passing rates over school size and budget per\n",
    "    student.\n",
